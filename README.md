# NMGCrystallography
Some of my crystallographic works:

## Class

**PlaneStrain** classical model of deformation twinning, showcasing two undistorted planes when a volume conserving plane strain shear deforms a continuous medium

**XRDBruker** allows analysis of raw XRD data output from the Bruker Instrument

## Functions:

**SFNMG** calculates the structure factor for face-centered NMG

**bragg2theta** calculates the bragg angle for diffraction for a given crystal system and radiation source

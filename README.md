# Magnetic Materials Laboratory
Some of my works while at Magnetic Materials Laboratory:

## Class

**PlaneStrain** classical model of deformation twinning, showcasing two undistorted planes when a volume conserving plane strain shear deforms a continuous medium

**XRDBruker** allows analysis of raw XRD data output from the Bruker Instrument

**ZwickTest** allows analysis of raw data output from compression testing in Zwick Instrument.

## Functions:

**SFNMG** calculates the structure factor for face-centered Ni-Mn-Ga

**bragg2theta** calculates the bragg angle for diffraction for a given crystal system and radiation source
